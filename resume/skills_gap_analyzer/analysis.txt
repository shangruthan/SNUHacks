Based on the provided job description and resume, here are the missing skills and information:

1. **Experience with cloud security**: Although you have mentioned Imperva Cloud and Sentinel, there is no explicit mention of experience with cloud security (AWS, Azure) and DevSecOps processes.
2. **Kubernetes security and containerization tools**: The job description mentions Kubernetes security and containerization tools as an advantage, but there is no mention of this in your resume.
3. **Advanced knowledge of firewalls**: While you have mentioned Palo Alto and Fortinet firewalls, the job description requires advanced knowledge of firewalls, which is not explicitly mentioned in your resume.
4. **SIEM systems and vulnerability scanning tools**: Although you have mentioned FortiSIEM and Elasticsearch, there is no detailed explanation of your experience with SIEM systems and vulnerability scanning tools.
5. **Cybersecurity frameworks**: The job description mentions ISO 27001, NIST, and GDPR frameworks, but your resume only mentions Introduction to Cybersecurity by CISCO, which may not be sufficient.
6. **Security certifications**: The job description prefers security certifications such as CEH, OSCP, or CISSP, but your resume only mentions ISC² Certified in cybersecurity (CC) and EHPT+Ethical hacking and penetration testing.
7. **Disaster recovery planning and compliance activities**: The job description mentions participation in disaster recovery planning and compliance activities, but there is no mention of this in your resume.
8. **Experience with Sigma rules implementation**: Although you have mentioned Sigma rules implementation, there is no detailed explanation of your experience with this.

1. **Cloud security courses**:
	* AWS Certified Security - Specialty
	* Azure Security Engineer Associate
	* DevSecOps courses on Udemy or Coursera
2. **Kubernetes security and containerization tools**:
	* Kubernetes Security Essentials on Coursera
	* Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes on Udemy
3. **Advanced firewall courses**:
	* Palo Alto Firewall Administration on Udemy
	* Fortinet Firewall Configuration and Management on Coursera
4. **SIEM systems and vulnerability scanning tools**:
	* SIEM Systems and Vulnerability Scanning on Udemy
	* Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) on Coursera
5. **Cybersecurity frameworks**:
